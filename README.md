I am Pedro! ❤️‍🔥

I was born in 1998 in the city of Sabadell, specifically in the province of Barcelona, so I know Spanish, Catalan and some English. 🇪🇸 

I am currently a fullstack student in web development. I understand HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery and some Python.
Next semester I will start backend development with PHP and SQL. 👨‍🎓👨‍💻

In the future I would like to dedicate myself professionally to Front End development with React, I don't rule out 100% the server side as I consider it the core of any important platform. 

Without further ado I leave you with my GitHub account so you can get ideas and give me feedback on the small projects I'm uploading. 🫂
